<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Accessing Library Services</h2>
<p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services</p>
<p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started.</p>

<h2>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h2>
<p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>
<div class="imageinsert">
	<img src="researchimages/research2.jpg" class="mdimage" alt="The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website." />
	<p class="caption">The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>
</div>
<p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>
<p>Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar.</p>
<p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>
