<h1>Requesting Resources</h1>
<p><a href=research.html>Return To Content Areas</a></p>
<h2>Requesting Articles</h2>
<p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine, as is the case in the figure below:</p>
<div class="imageinsert">
	<img src="researchimages/requestsimg1.jpg" class="mdimage" alt="Academic Search Premier Website" />
</div>
<p>Clicking on the <span class="bold">Get Article</span> link will direct you to a page like this, where you will either be able to retrieve the article through another web site or where you will request the article through your myILL account.</p>
<div class="imageinsert">
	<img src="researchimages/requestsimg2.jpg" class="mdimage" alt="For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL" />
	<p class="caption">For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL</p>
</div>
<p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you will need to register before you are able to request an article. Think of myILL as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you, because that is essentially what you are doing. You will be notified by email when your article is ready to download, and you can log into myILL and view your page of delivered items. For more help requesting articles, see the Library FAQ and How-to Pages.</p>
<h2>Requesting a Book From Another Library</h2>
<p>When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library system. If you are unsuccessful in finding the title you are looking for, next try to locate the book in I-Share. If <span class="emphasis">I-Share</span> yields no results, the next step is to search for your book in <span class="emphasis">WorldCat</span>.</p>

<h3>Being Realistic</h3>
<p class="bold">When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember any of the titles you look up or that you will be able to find them again using past searches. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or on your flash drive.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are confused when using any of the library systems, you can always refer back to the Library FAQ and How-to Pages which have a selection of tutorials explaining the step-by-step instructions for requesting resources.</p>
<h2>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h2>
<p>Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them. One of the resources that Jane finds quoted often in academic papers is the 1923 text English for Engineers written by S. A. Harbarger. She decides that this is a useful resource to examine for her project, and makes a note of the title, author, and year in her Google Docs list of resources that she is compiling. After a quick search in I-Share, she notices that it is available at the University of Illinois library in Chicago; she makes a note of this as well in her list of resources. Although she has to work on another project, she knows that she can easily come back to her research notes and resume work.</p>
